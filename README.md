# Project Title

NextWatch

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

Nextwatch is a place for people to find the upcoming new tvs/movies/animes and keep track of the ones they are interested in.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Nextwatch shows only the upcoming new movies/tv/animes. A lot of website shows the previous seasons or old shows, which is too much information for people only follow new movies/tvs/animes. Instead, nextwatch is the platform that only focus on new ones and automatically delete the previous season old stuff on the list.

### User Profile

- Movie/TV/Anime new season followers:
- looing for the new season shows/tvs
